A collection of Ruby scripts I've written with notes to learn the language. Simple math, string, and say hello type scripts. I thought a good place to start now that I have a handle on the basics of the language is to recreate a lot of the utility methods I've seen used in AS3. While some are already built into Ruby I figured this would be good practice. I have Math max and min methods, and separate versions using yield to reuse "sandwich code" and a repeat method for strings.
